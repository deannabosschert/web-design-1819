-  For a blind child, the texture is the first clue (as cited in Hatwell, Streri, & Gentaz, 2000).

The six key features of a TiB are:

- writing in both large print and Braille
- tactile illustrations (whatever the production technique used)
- color contrast for low vision
- a binding which allows pages to be fully horizontal
- a hard cover page
- be equally as attractive as picture books made for sighted children

# Design Principles for this particular case
## **People use different devices in different ways.**


## **Clarity is job #1**
- Clarity is the first and most important job of any interface. To be effective using an interface you've designed, people must be able to recognize what it is, care about why they would use it, understand what the interface is helping them interact with, predict what will happen when they use it, and then successfully interact with it. While there is room for mystery and delayed gratification in interfaces, there is no room for confusion. Clarity inspires confidence and leads to further use. One hundred clear screens is preferable to a single cluttered one.

## **Conserve attention at all costs**
- We live in a world of interruption. It's hard to read in peace anymore without something trying to distract us and direct our attention elsewhere. Attention is precious. Don't litter the side of your applications with distractible material…remember why the screen exists in the first place. If someone is reading let them finish reading before showing that advertisement (if you *must*). Honor attention and not only will your readers be happier, your results will be better. When use is the primary goal, attention becomes the prerequisite. Conserve it at all costs.

## **Keep users in control**
- Humans are most comfortable when they feel in control of themselves and their environment. Thoughtless software takes away that comfort by forcing people into unplanned interactions, confusing pathways, and surprising outcomes. Keep users in control by regularly surfacing system status, by describing causation (if you do this that will happen) and by giving insight into what to expect at every turn. Don't worry about stating the obvious…the obvious almost never is.

## **One primary action per screen**
- Every screen we design should support a single action of real value to the person using it. This makes it easier to learn, easier to use, and easier to add to or build on when necessary. Screens that support two or more primary actions become confusing quickly. Like a written article should have a single, strong thesis, every screen we design should support a single, strong action that is its raison d'etre.

## **Progressive disclosure**
- Show only what is necessary on each screen. If people are making a choice, show enough information to allow them the choice, then dive into details on a subsequent screen. Avoid the tendency to over-explain or show everything all at once. When possible, defer decisions to subsequent screens by progressively disclosing information as necessary. This will keep your interactions more clear.

## **Keep secondary actions secondary**
- Screens with a single primary action can have multiple secondary actions but they need to be kept secondary! The reason why your article exists isn't so that people can share it on Twitter…it exists for people to read and understand it. Keep secondary actions secondary by making them lighter weight visually or shown after the primary action has been achieved.

## **Provide a natural next step**
- Very few interactions are meant to be the last, so thoughtfully design a next step for each interaction a person has with your interface. Anticipate what the next interaction should be and design to support it. Just as we like in human conversation, provide an opening for further interaction. Don't leave a person hanging because they've done what you want them to do…give them a natural next step that helps them further achieve their goals.

## **Help people inline**
- In ideal interfaces, help is not necessary because the interface is learnable and usable. The step below this, *reality*, is one in which help is inline and contextual, available only when and where it is needed, hidden from view at all other times. Asking people to go to help and find an answer to their question puts the onus on them to know what they need. Instead build in help where it is needed…just make sure that it is out of the way of people who already know how to use your interface.

## **A crucial moment: the zero state**
- The first time experience with an interface is crucial, yet often overlooked by designers. In order to best help our users get up to speed with our designs, it is best to design for the zero state, the state in which nothing has yet occurred. This state shouldn't be a blank canvas…it should provide direction and guidance for getting up to speed. Much of the friction of interaction is in that initial context…once people understand the rules they have a much higher likelihood of success.

## Bring to the user all the information and tools needed for each step of the process
## The computer, interface, and task environment all “belong” to the user, but user-autonomy doesn’t mean we abandon rules



# Jaws shortcuts

CTRL+esc = windows menu OR windows key
Windows key + tab = taskbar menu
Windows key + tab + tab = system tray
Insert + F10 = back to nav
Close window= alt+F4 key

Press H to navigate through the headings. After reading the heading, the screen reader will automatically read the content following that header.
