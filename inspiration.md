-  For a blind child, the texture is the first clue (as cited in Hatwell, Streri, & Gentaz, 2000).

The six key features of a TiB are:

- writing in both large print and Braille
- tactile illustrations (whatever the production technique used)
- color contrast for low vision
- a binding which allows pages to be fully horizontal
- a hard cover page
- be equally as attractive as picture books made for sighted children
